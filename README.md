This is my first attempt at building a React based frontend for a webpage.
I am hoping to learn best coding practices along the way for front end development,
as well as hoping to run into as many complications as possible. Learning comes
when you are frustrated, so I am hoping (and planning) on being frustrated a
lot over the coming weeks...

Dan here 11/24/2020 - Man what I would give to go back to these simpler times... Anyways, the updates here are pretty small.  Think I just spun the photos and changed the order of some videos because I do not like the thumbnails...  

This project is a mess of a mashup of a few frontend techniques and libraries including styled components, React-Router, React Carousel, and React Responsive

React Responsive was just a quick choice for a media query library.
