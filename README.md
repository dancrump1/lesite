This is my first attempt at building a React based frontend for a webpage.
I am hoping to learn best coding practices along the way for front end development,
as well as hoping to run into as many complications as possible. Learning comes
when you are frustrated, so I am hoping (and planning) on being frustrated a
lot over the coming weeks
